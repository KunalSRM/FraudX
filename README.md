# üí≥ FraudX ‚Äì Credit Card Fraud Detection

FraudX is a **machine learning project** designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a **Random Forest classifier** to predict whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on anonymized transaction features.

The project includes:  
- Data preprocessing and handling **class imbalance** using SMOTE.  
- Model training and evaluation using **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
- A **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions of new transactions.  
- Clear folder structure and modular code for **train, predict, and deployment**.

This project is ideal for **practical ML portfolio work**, demonstrating real-world binary classification and web deployment.
